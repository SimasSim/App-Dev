1. This program makes a matching game, and matching games need an even total number of item to play, This program crashes because it chooses two tiles at a time to
assign a color so when an odd number of tiles is present the code cannot complete.

2. I made it so that if two odd numbers were entered by the user the columns would be made even so that the game could be completed.

3. My solutions main drawback is that it does not actually follow what the user requested, but if i did follow as the user requested than the game could not be completed.
I figured this would be the best solution because the board will still look nice and not have a single tile attached to make the total even, and it does not have an odd number
of tiles meaning it can actually be completed.
